# What is motivating me to change my career?
- I have spent 15+ years of my life pursuing music and hoping that I would make
a full time career out of it. Unfortunately, music is a very tough field to 'make it'
in, and I suffered an injury that ultimately prevented me from moving forward in music.
- After the injury, I took a job with some local youth music organizations, thinking that
I would find joy in providing musical opportunities for kids. Ultimately, I was far from actually working
with the kids and stuck doing administrative work for an unsustainable wage.
- I decided to return to my alma mater to take advantage of their amazing tuition benefits, and rekindled an
interest in computer science with a few classes. My partner has also been extremely supportive and is in the
tech field as well.
- After taking a few classes, I decided I needed to dive in full time. So my motivation right now is a hope
to find a career that is challenging, fulfilling, and exciting.
